h1. merb_cucumber

Merb + Cucumber integration with Webrat support.

h2. Migrating to merb_cucumber 0.5.0

merb_cucumber 0.5.0 now requires cucumber 0.1.13, which introduces some breaking changes. If you were already using
merb_cucumber, you'll need to do the following:

* Change the last line of bin/cucumber to be:

  Cucumber::CLI.execute ARGV

* Add a cucumber.yml to your Merb.root with the following contents:

  default: --format pretty features

If you experience any problems, please contact me (david) on github.

h2. Requirements

* merb-core >= 1.0.6.1
* cucumber  >= 0.1.13
* webrat    >= 0.3.2 (Optional)

h2. First Time

Inside your merb project root, run
  
  $ merb-gen cucumber
  
For Webrat support, run 

  $ merb-gen cucumber --session-type webrat

This will also install a sample login feature that should pass if you're using merb-auth.

h2. Usage

To execute all the features run

  $ rake features

h2. Notes

* When you are implementing the steps of an scenario, please use the new request test helper, if you try to use the
  dispatch_to method, it won't work as expected.
* Webrat methods other than 'visits' are now singular only.
